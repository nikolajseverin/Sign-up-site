## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JS 

### Continued development

I’m currently facing a challenge with making my site responsive after going live with my HTML and CSS project. I’ve built the layout for desktop screens (1440px), and it looks good at that size. However, I’m not sure how to approach making it work for mobile devices (like 375px width).

When I open my live site and try to resize the window, I can’t get it to show how it would look at 375px unless I use Chrome’s developer tools and switch to mobile view manually. This makes it hard for me to understand what the proper workflow or strategy is for developing a responsive site that works well on both desktop and mobile.

I know that media queries are involved, but I’m confused about:
	•	When and how to test mobile views effectively (especially after going live).
	•	How to set up a proper development process for building mobile responsiveness after the desktop version is done.
	•	Whether I should rely on the Chrome inspector tools for mobile views, or if there’s a better approach.

Any advice or guidance on how to structure the development and testing for responsiveness would be super helpful!
